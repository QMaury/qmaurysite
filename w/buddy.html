		&emsp;Hope you're well buddy.<br><br>
		
		&emsp;A dude in flip flops on the street called me his buddy today.<br><br>

		&emsp;Buddy.<br>
		&emsp;BUDDY.<br>
		&emsp;Hey buddy!<br><br>

		&emsp;Typically something that a father calls his son, though these days probably has more as a corny sitcom-dad sort of tone.<br>
		&emsp;I dunno. I dunno actually.<br>
		&emsp;I don't think my Dad ever called me buddy.<br>
		&emsp;And I don't have a son, so I call just everybody buddy.<br><br>

		&emsp;Hey buddy!<br><br>

		&emsp;More of a name for a dog than a person. It's endearing.<br>
		&emsp;For some, downright embarrassing.<br><br>

		&emsp;Some people think that being called buddy is a sign of disrespect. Perhaps it is.<br>
		&emsp;As someone who uses the word "buddy" alot, I think of it more as a casual, neutral friendliness.<br>
		&emsp;Maybe I picked it up doing customer service so much.<br>
		&emsp;When you give a nickname to somebody the second you meet them it's like you're almost friends already.<br>
		&emsp;Like you're..<br>
		&emsp;Buddies?<br><br>

		&emsp;Something like that?<br><br>

		&emsp;I would probably hate living if I felt embarrassment at another human if they called me buddy.<br><br>

		&emsp;"You call me your buddy? You mock me!"<br><br>

		&emsp;You just couldn't make friends that way.<br><br>

		&emsp;Anyway. I'm getting a knock at the door. I'll write you another email tomorrow morning baby!!<br>
		&emsp;Hope you're doing well. Cya.<br><br>

		&emsp;&emsp;	- All the best, Harry Mowelawn
