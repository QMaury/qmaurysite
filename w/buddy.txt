	A dude in flip flops on the street called me his buddy today.

	Buddy.
	BUDDY.
	Hey buddy!

	Typically something that a father calls his son, though these days probably has more as a corny sitcom-dad sort of tone.
	I dunno. I dunno actually.
	I don't think my Dad ever called me buddy.
	And I don't have a son, so I call just everybody buddy.

	Hey buddy!

	More of a name for a dog than a person. It's endearing.
	For some, downright embarrassing.

	Some people think that being called buddy is a sign of disrespect. Perhaps it is.
	As someone who uses the word "buddy" alot, I think of it more as a casual, neutral friendliness.
	Maybe I picked it up doing customer service so much.
	When you give a nickname to somebody the second you meet them it's like you're almost friends already.
	Like you're..
	Buddies?

	Something like that?

	I would probably hate living if I felt disrespect when another fellow human called me their buddy.

	"You call me your buddy? You mock me!"

	You just couldn't make friends that way.

	Anyway. I'm getting a knock at the door. I'll write you another email tomorrow morning baby!!
	Hope you're doing well.
