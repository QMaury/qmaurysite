	<h2><u>Over-reliance on technology (And why big companies are fucking gay)</u></h2>
	<p>I recently have been trying to get a summer job. One of the places I tried getting a job at was this big superstore. I thought that it would probably be
	real easy, because I have a friend who works there, and she could get me a referral. Boy, was I wrong.<br> So, she puts in a referral for me, and I wait a couple of days.
	after a couple of days.... nothing. hm. So I sent in an actual application because maybe they just have no way of contacting me after the referral. I moseyed on over 
	to their awful, confusing, script-heavy, bloated shitty website, and send in an application after a half hour of navigating this piece of shit. wait a couple more days,
	nothing. wait 2 weeks, nothing. about a month goes by when my friend who referred me, tells me that they couldn't find my application, so I gotta try again. well, thats 
	weird but, I can apply again, sure. So I send in another application and about 2 weeks go by then she tells me I gotta apply again, but under a different email.
	What?? So, they could find my second application, but discarded it because of the email address?? Fuck, this is getting annoying by now.<br> So I send in a THIRD application
	with a new email address that I made, and after another 2 weeks they get to me, and ask for my personal info. (Social Insurance Number, bank info, etc.) Oh. cool.
	looks like I'm getting the job, finally. Or at least I THINK so? Why would they ask me such personal shit if I wasn't gonna get the job? By this point I'm remembering
	a previous job I had at a burger place and how much easier and faster that was. I would show up to the store with a resume, come back later for an interview, and then
	they just call me when they wanted me to show up. Fast and simple. Didn't require an internet connection.<br> The superstore starts sending me emails that imply I'm pretty much
	already hired, but not telling me where or when to show up. They would send me links to a Faggot-soft sign-in page but wouldn't give me any login credentials for which
	to sign up with. All the emails they send were generated by a robot, and were a no-reply type deal, so I couldn't really communicate my issues. My only communication 
	with the store was using my friend as a middle-man to deliver info, but that has its limitations. I decided to just call a manager there and maybe they could help.
	I hadda stay on hold for about 5 minutes when my call finally got through to the manager. I told her my name, and what my problem is an- Hung up. They hung up on me.<br>
	Ok, fuck this place. They clearly don't know what they're doing and the school year is about to start, so fuck em. I can't be wasting my time with this. something like,
	5 days before the end of summer vacation, I get a call from the store asking for me. "Hello I'm with [SUPERSTORE], are you [QMAURY]?" "no." hung up on them. 
	These retards wasted my time for the whole summer, and now that the school year is starting and I literally CAN'T work, they try to contact me?<br> In hindsight,
	what I think was going on was, a big company is trying to look hip with the kids, so they set up this big complicated system for applying, and then don't know how to use it.
	wasting their own time, and mines too. I wrote a thread on /r9k/ (i think i dont remember) explaining this bullshit, and I had multiple anons tell me that even if they
	did tell me when to show up and work, they probably wouldn't know my name and not pay me. I also had another anon tell me to just show up to the store in person and say,
	"I dont have a computer and no smart-phone. We do everything by paper."
	<br>
	anyway, this post is getting too long for comfort, so I'm gonna cut it off here.
	<br>
	piss off.</p>
